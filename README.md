ft_transcendence is a 42 school team project where we have to create a **SPA (Single Page Application) website** allowing us to play **Pong Game**.

## Status

* Success
* Grade: 100/100

## Rules

![alt-text](https://github.com/ThibautCharpentier/ft_transcendence/blob/main/previews/dashboard.png)

* Our application must be compatible with **Google Chrome**. We have to use **Javascript** to develop **the frontend**. The user must be able to use the browser's **Back** and **Forward** buttons.

* Users must be able to participate in a **Pong Game** match in real-time against another user on the same computer using the same keyboard. A player must also be able to organize a tournament.
A tournament consists of several players who can play against each other.

* Any password stored in the database must be **encrypted**. The website must be protected against **SQL/XSS injections**. It is mandatory to implement an **SSL certificate** (which can be self-signed).

### Modules

![alt-text](https://github.com/ThibautCharpentier/ft_transcendence/blob/main/previews/pong.png)

To validate the project, we have to choose several modules from a list. Each module is worth either **1 or 0.5 point**. We have to implement a value of **7 points**.

| Value | Theme | Module | Description |
| ----- | ----- | ------ | ----------- |
| 1 | Web | Using a backend framework | We have to use **Django** framework. |
| 0.5 | Web | Using a frontend toolkit/framework | We have to use **Bootstrap** toolkit. |
| 0.5 | Web | Using a database | We have to use **PostgreSQL**. |
| 1 | User management | Standard user management | Users must be able to **register/authenticate** to the application. Users have an **unique username**. They must be able to update their **profile** and upload an **avatar**. They must also be able to add other users as **friends** and view their **status**. User profiles display **statistics**, such as wins and looses. Each user has a **game history**. |
| 1 | User management | Remote players | It is possible to have two remote players. Each player is on a different computer and playing the same **Pong Game** match. |
| 1 | Cybersecurity | Implementation of 2FA and JWT | Users must be able to use **two-factor authentication (2FA)**. Then, if they use **2FA**, they receive a **single-use code** by **email** to use as double authentication. We have to implement **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** as a method of authentication and authorization, ensuring user sessions and access to resources are managed securely. |
| 1 | Graphics | Implementation of advanced 3D technicals | We have to use **ThreeJS/WebGL**. |
| 0.5 | Accessibility | Support on all types of devices | The website must be compatible with **tablets** and **smartphones** (using the touch screen). |
| 0.5 | Accessibility | Extend web browsers compatibility | The website must work on at least one additional browser, like **Firefox**. |

## Usage

First of all, you need to create an **.env** file in the root of the project, like this:
```
FRONT_URL=https://localhost:8080
FRONT_URL2=https://127.0.0.1:8080

#ifconfig enp4s0f0 | grep 'inet' | awk '{print $2}' | head -n 1
#OR
#ip addr show enp4s0f0 | grep 'inet ' | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d/ -f1 | head -n 1
HOST_IP=

#Settings of your database, by default it can be:
DB_HOST=db
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_NAME=transcendence

#Put whatever you want for this one:
JWT_SECRET_KEY=ItIsASecretTokenKey

#You have to use an email communication platform to send email (like sendgrid for example) and put your settings here:
EMAIL_HOST =
EMAIL_HOST_USER =
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD =
EMAIL_PORT =

#Put whatever you want for this one too:
SECRET_KEY= 'ItIsASecretKey'

```

Then, run the project with:
```
docker compose up --build
```
If the project is already built, use:
```
docker compose up
```

Then, go to your local IP address at port 8080:
```
https://localhost:8080/
```
```
https://127.0.0.1:8080/
```
